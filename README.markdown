#Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first example of the Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl. It should help me with my RoR as well as git practice.

The documentation for this can be found at: 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) 
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).
